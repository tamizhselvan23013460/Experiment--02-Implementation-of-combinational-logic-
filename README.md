# Experiment--02-Implementation-of-combinational-logic
Implementation of combinational logic gates
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
## Equipments Required:
Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher
Software – Quartus prime
# Procedure:
```
*Create a project with required entities.
*Create a module along with respective file name.
*Run the respective programs for the given boolean equations.
*Run the module and get the respective RTL outputs.
*Create university program(VWF) for getting timing diagram.
*Give the respective inputs for timing diagram and obtain the results.
```
